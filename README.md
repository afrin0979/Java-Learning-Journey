"# Java-Learning-Journey" 
This repository contains my daily Java learning journey, including code examples, concepts, and exercises.

## Repository Structure
- `YYYY-MM-DD/`: Folder for each day's learning
  - `Notes.md`: Summary of concepts learned
  - `Code/`: Java programs for the day

## How to Navigate
- Each dayâ€™s folder is named with the date.
- Inside, `Notes.md` contains a brief summary, and `Code/` contains all programs.
